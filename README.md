# DiscreteMath

This project was an assignment for a Discrete Math class at Salt Lake City Community College.The purpose of the assignment is to find an implementation of various sorting algorithms on the internet and measure the significant comparisons each algorithm will produce. The comparisons will be used to measure the efficiency of each algorithm to determine which one is the best.
